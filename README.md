# Scripts for analysing XRD measurements
The repository contains notebooks and scripts to perform the azimuthal integration of a scattering pattern.
You can either use notebooks 01-03 for calibration, intensity integration and for data visualization, or you can use a shorter notebook (05-pyFAI) which contains calibration, intensity integration and visualization all in one.

The scripts were developed in particular for the [XRD instrument](https://www.su.se/department-of-materials-and-environmental-chemistry/research/infrastructure/x-ray-facility-1.606266?open-collapse-boxes=ccbd-singlecrystalxraydiffractometerbrukerd8venture) at Stockholm University.
